  <p>What language to learn first? </p>
   <p> As you all know that coding is the future, we should learn how to code. So first of all the thing is that which language to learn first?. So in this article I will tell you about in which order you can learn languages. <!--And the answer is that it matters according to what do you want to do with coding? make apps and games?  make website? mobile development? If you want to make website, then--></p> 
  <ol>
    <li class="html-li">
      <strong>HTML</strong> -  HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup<strong>L</strong>anguage. It is the most important language to learn first. because there can be no page built without HTML. for eg, the page through which you are reading this article is also built with HTML! so if you want to be a web developer, then you cant be a web developer without HTML.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="css-li"> <strong>CSS</strong> -
        CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading<strong>S</strong>tyle<strong>S</strong>heets is required for styling. So if you want your website beautiful, then you would need css.
        With HTML you cant style anything. So I think you should learn CSS after HTML. </li>
      <br>
        <li> <strong>JS</strong> -
          JS stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript.  you need to learn Javascript to add functionality in your website. E.G. in amazon, when you click on add to cart it adds the item in the cart. So for that kind of stuff we need Javascript.
        </li> <br> 
        <li><strong>Python</strong> - Python is a multi use language. it can also be used for backhend, for small works, website use and more.I recommend you to learn python because it has easy syntax. It is also easy to learn and read. for eg. if you want to write hello world in python you will write print("hello world")</li>

        <h2 class="where_to_learn_languages">From where to learn these languages?</h2>
        <p class="language_platforms">This is also a question of many people including me when I didnt know much about programming. So I recommend you to learn languages from youtube courses.
There is a lot of free content available on youtube, for eg, codewithharry, mosh hammedani and more.
They have content for like 10 hours of the language. <strong><a class = "courses"href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry"target="_blank">Click to view CodeWithHarry Youtube channel!</a> </strong><br>

<strong><a class = "courses"href="https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh"target="_blank">Click to view Mosh hammedani youtube channel</a></strong> <br>
But when you need to learn more advanced, then you need courses for like 40 hours 50 hours. So for that I recommend Udemy. Udemy have lengthy courses and understandable too. I like Jonas schmedtmann course on HTML CSS and JS. The only thing is that they are paid. but worth it. <br>

 Good luck on your Coding!
