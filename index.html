    <p>
      As you know, if you play chess, you know that everyone is trying to climb
      the rating ladder. people look for famous chess openings on youtube or
      they buy courses so that they can master that particular opening and climb
      the rating ladder. Some of the chess openings that I am going to show you
      are down -

    <ol class="openings">
      <li class="sicilian">
        <strong> Sicilian defense.</strong> Sicilian defense is a opening which
        starts with the move e4 and then black responds with c5. It's really
        good opening for anyone if they know what they're doing.If they have
        some prep with it then They're fine. You need to have a weapon against
        this opening. some of the famous variations are alphin variation with
        the move c3, Smith mora gambit starting with the move d4 allowing black
        to take the pawn and then offer another pawn on c3 and more. Click the
        video below. You can check out other channels as well but I like the
        channel gothamchess And its #1 Chess Channel Today with more than a

      <li class="vienna">
        <strong>The vienna</strong> The vienna starts with the move e4 e5 and
        then knight to c3 (nc3) There is also a Vienna Gambit in this. when the
        opponent play the move knight to f6 and then we offer black a pawn. now
        the best move is to decline with the move pawn to d6. There are some
        tricky variations in the accepted line when black takes the pawn. there
        are many variations. check this video to learn all the main variations
        of the vienna gambit.

      <li class="caro-kann">
        <strong>Caro Kann </strong>caro kann starts with the e4 c6 and then d4
        is the most expected move. then we play d5 trying to exchange the pawns.
        But the most natural move is to push the pawn because that dont allow
        the normal knight move. now we play c5 and if white takes the pawn then
        we recapture with the bishop and we have 2 central pawns against of one
        and we have a piece out before white has. There is a lot to play with
        this opening. Check out the video below

      </li>
      <li class="queens-gambit">
        <strong> Queen's gambit</strong> Queens gambit starts with the move d4
        d5 c4. white offers a pawn to black. The objective is that if black
        takes, it's known as the queens gambit accepted line. you can take the
        control of the center and will soon regain that pawn on c4 by e4 with
        having the threat of bishop takes on c4 if b5 supporting the c4 pawn,
        you just try to deflect the pawn by the move a4. If black plays a6
        thinking that they protected the pawn then they didnt. because if a
        takes b5 a takes b5 and then the rook hangs. So black plays the move c6
        and now you dont take you just maintain the pressure and develop take
        the center and then castle kingside. it's not obvious that you are going
        to face only the accepted line. you can face the declined lines too. so
        prepare for that as well. One of the main weapons against the
        queens-gambit is the move e5 which is known albin countergambit. This is
        a very tricky gambit. check out the video down to prepare some of the
        main lines. Look the Albin countergambit lasker trap below to!

        <strong>Traxler Counterattack</strong>
        Traxler counterattack is not a opening but a great counterattack to the
        Fried liver. So we start with e4 e5 nf3 nc6 and then bishop to c4 known
        as the italian game. White targets the f7 pawn. we play knight to f6 and
        then invite him to play ng5 double attacking the pawn.This is known as
        the fried Liver attack. But You can surprise your opponent with the move
        bishop to c5 and now if White takes with the knight then you give bishop
        takes e2 check! if your opponent takes then you give knight takes e4
        check. now your opponent has 2 options. he can go forward or back . if
        your opponent goes forward, then hes going to lose the entire game.
        Let's say he plays king to f3, now we will play the move queen to h4
        check and now if white takes the rook, then queen to f4 check, Now white
        has one legal move king to e2, then we give queen f2 check king to d3
        only move and then we sacrifice another knight by knight to b4 check and
        the only legal move is to take the knight and then queen f4 is a
        checkmate. So therefore white cant go forward but if there is king to e1
        after knight e4 check, then queen h4 check, white has to play the move
        g3 and then we take with the knight and pawn takes knight is the only
        move in this position, pawn takes knight then we take the rook with a
        check, ke2 only move so that you defend the queen and then you can just
        play queen to g2 check getting the queen out of danger and now king move
        is forced. if white plays king to d3 then we play queen takes pawn check, ofc now if king moves forward I mean it's just checkmate. so ke2 only move, now comes another pawn sacrifice. with the move d5 attacking the bishop. if bishop takes pawn then bishop to g4 check king has to move to f1 only legal move and then we play bishop to h3 check, now king to e2 and then knight to d4 checkmate!  or if bishop blocks, then take the bishop with queen and then queen to f1 mate!
        <!-- options, to sacrifice the queen for no reason at f3, or bishop to d3,
        and when white play bishop to d3, dont take the bishop, instead castle.
        so that you can get you rook out of the danger and your opponent has 2
        hanging pieces and you're definitely going to get the bishop as its
        pinned and are completely winning.--> So the best move according to the 
        engine and me is king to g1. And then black can play queen h4 threatning
        mate on f2. but the thing is that now white can play g3 and its totally
        fine. And The best move is not to take with the knight forking the rook
        and the queen, but instead play bishop takes in that case because you
        take a pawn and its a check king has to go and then just slide back and
        you're winning. There's so much poison in this attack I cant even
        express you! Check out the video down

    <h2>Learn endgames</h2>
    <p>
      Endgame is a very important part of the game. You need to learn endgames.
      For example, if you are having a queen and a king and 0 pawns vs a lonely
      king and 0 pawns but you dont know how to win a endgame with a queen, then
      its very bad because you are up a queen and the game will end in a draw.
      So you need to learn endgames.
    </p>
    <ol class="endgames">
      <li>
        <strong> Queen Endgame</strong> The Queen endgame is very easy and
        simple. Rule no.1 keep knight opposition with the queen. Keep a knight
        opposition with the queen to the king. Your motive is to bring the king
        to the corner and then bring your king and then checkmate your opponent.
        But be careful about one thing, In a position like this image dont play
        queen to f7! because if you do the game will result in a draw by
        stalemate. So you have to be careful about this part and then bring your
        king closer in a position on which the king can get checkmated .Like in
        this position, g7 looks good so bring your king to g6, and black has to
        shuffle his king back and forth until checkmate. That was all about the
        queen end game.

      </li><br>
      <li>
        <strong>Two Queen endgame</strong> Two queen queens Endgame is very
        simple and the easiest endgame. just let your queens be on a diagonal
        one square and then checkmate like in the video down.
         <video controls height="220" width="390" muted>

      </li><br>
      <li><strong>Rook endgame</strong>
      Just look down the video of the rook endgame. I set up a random position and played. You'll get to know yourself how to mate with a rook after watching that video.</li> <br>

  <p>What language to learn first? </p>
   <p> As you all know that coding is the future, we should learn how to code. So first of all the thing is that which language to learn first?. So in this article I will tell you about in which order you can learn languages. </p> 
  <ol>
    <li class="html-li">
      <strong>HTML</strong> -  HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup<strong>L</strong>anguage. It is the most important language to learn first. because there can be no page built without HTML. for eg, the page through which you are reading this article is also built with HTML! so if you want to be a web developer, then you cant be a web developer without HTML.</li>
      <br>
      <li class="css-li"> <strong>CSS</strong> -
        CSS stands for <strong>C</strong>ascading<strong>S</strong>tyle<strong>S</strong>heets is required for styling. So if you want your website beautiful, then you would need css.
        With HTML you cant style anything. So I think you should learn CSS after HTML. </li>
      <br>
        <li> <strong>JS</strong> -
          JS stands for <strong>J</strong>ava<strong>S</strong>cript.  you need to learn Javascript to add functionality in your website. E.G. in amazon, when you click on add to cart it adds the item in the cart. So for that kind of stuff we need Javascript.
        </li> <br> 
        <li><strong>Python</strong> - Python is a multi use language. it can also be used for backhend, for small works, website use and more.I recommend you to learn python because it has easy syntax. It is also easy to learn and read. for eg. if you want to write hello world in python you will write print("hello world")</li>

        <h2 class="where_to_learn_languages">From where to learn these languages?</h2>
        <p class="language_platforms">This is also a question of many people including me when I didnt know much about programming. So I recommend you to learn languages from youtube courses.
There is a lot of free content available on youtube, for eg, codewithharry, mosh hammedani and more.
They have content for like 10 hours of the language. <strong><a class = "courses"href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithHarry"target="_blank">Click to view CodeWithHarry Youtube channel!</a> </strong><br>

<strong><a class = "courses"href="https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh"target="_blank">Click to view Mosh hammedani youtube channel</a></strong> <br>
But when you need to learn more advanced, then you need courses for like 40 hours 50 hours. So for that I recommend Udemy. Udemy have lengthy courses and understandable too. I like Jonas schmedtmann course on HTML CSS and JS. The only thing is that they are paid. but worth it. <br>
 <strong><a class = "courses"href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/"target="_blank">Click to view all the Jonas schmedtmann courses!</a> </strong><br>
 Good luck on your Coding!
